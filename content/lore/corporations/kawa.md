# Kawakawa Inc

KAWA is a corp founded in [Early Access](../early-access.md) on April 18, 2021.  Its founding members consist of CrimsonCoder (CFP), NoxW (NCS), Platypet (PLSE), jansaell (TONE), KitsuneSan (TYCO), and TechTheAwesome (OHY).   KAWA was initially set up with a discord server and spreadsheets for corporation organization by members of AHI, a corporation established in a previous iteration of the in-game universe, as a way to encourage the growth of new corporations consisting of newer players. Our goal is to grow first as a corporation, second as individual companies.
