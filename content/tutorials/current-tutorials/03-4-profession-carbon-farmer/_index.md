Hello. Welcome back to APEX, and thank you for choosing the comprehensive Carbon Farmer Profession set up guide.

As mentioned when you picked the carbon farmer profession, Carbon is a vital resource used across different industries. You will find similarities between this profession and users that started with the Victualler profession due to the fact that both require water and a fertile planet to make a profit.

To start lets click the construct command in the base tile. From here, you will see you have the infrastructure tab selected, it’s here that you can find a catalog of habitation units that are available for you to build. Since our starter workforce will largely contain pioneers, lets build two pioneer habitation units. After that, lets navigate to the Pioneers tab of the construction tile. It’s here that you can see the farmstead, and the Incinerator. If you notice, they have a workforce requirement. In this case, the Farmstead  will require 50 pioneers, and the Incinerator will require 40 pioneers. Since you have been given enough construction materials for 2 pioneer habitation units you have room on your base for 200 pioneers. Let's build 2 farmsteads and the incinerator.

Next, lets once again adjust the UI by expanding the bottom right two windows vertically a bit. Inside the upper blank tile, we are going to put your production information in there, so please navigate to your bases tile and select production. With the Tile that just appeared, please drag it into the blank tile.

Next, we also want to find out about the resources your workforce will consume to produce your goods, so select the workforce button in the base tile, and drag it to the bottommost blank tile.

You will now see in the production tile that you have two production lines. Please select the NEW ORDER button above the Farmstead. You will see that a production order tile appeared. It is here that you can order production on a variety of recipes, so in this case as an example, lets select from the production template the Hydrocarbon Plant recipe. As you can see, it requires 2 units of water.

In your inventory you have enough water for 32 Hydrocarbon plants. Let's fire up the farmstead by selecting the Queue order button, and click  the Queue order button one more time as you have two farmsteads. Make sure you stay on top of your production chains and queue up additional orders to ensure they are constantly producing profit for you! Now, lets fire up an order on your incinerator. The incinerator works by burning carbon-based produce into raw carbon. Using the Hydrocarbon plants in your inventory you can burn them to produce carbon. Select the Hydrocarbon plant recipe and queue that order.

Now that your two farms and incinerator are running, it’s best to wait until you get a sizable carbon pile in your inventory. After you feel like you have enough carbon, you will it take to the market to sell. Once you have sold your first batch, its recommended you purchase more hydrocarbon plants for your incinerator and water for your farms to continue the loop.

This has been the Comprehensive Carbon Farmer Profession set up guide, and has been indicated as complete by the APEX module, so this video broadcast will now be concluded. Please continue further to the next video broadcast about next steps with your base. Thank you for choosing the Advanced System for the Facilitation of Production and Exchange for the Exodus of Mankind.
