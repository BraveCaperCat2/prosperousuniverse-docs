Hello. Welcome back to APEX, and thank you for choosing the comprehensive Metallurgist Profession setup guide.

As mentioned when you picked the Metallurgist profession, Metallurgists work at the base of several industry branches. Your job will be to extract raw ore from a planet’s surface, and then smelt this ore into various refined metals that other colonists will use.

To start let's click the construct command in the base tile. From here, you will see you have the infrastructure tab selected, it’s here that you can find a catalog of habitation units that are available for you to build. Since our starter workforce will largely contain pioneers, lets build two pioneer habitation units. After that, lets navigate to the Resources tab of the construction tile. It’s here that you can see the Extractor. If you notice, the Extractor has a workforce requirement. In this case, the Extractor will require 60 pioneers. Since you have been given enough construction materials for 2 pioneer habitation units you have room on your base for 200 pioneers. Let's build the Extractor

Next, lets navigate to the pioneers tab. It’s here that you find the Smelter, please build one of those.

Let's adjust the UI by expanding the bottom right two windows vertically a bit. Inside the upper blank tile, we are going to put your production information in there, so please navigate to your base tile and select production. With the Tile that just appeared, please drag it into the blank tile.

Next, we also want to find out about the resources your workforce will consume to produce your goods, so select the workforce button in the base tile, and drag it to the bottommost blank tile.

You will now see in the production tile that you have two production lines. Please select the NEW ORDER button above the Extractor. You will see that a production order tile appeared. It is here that you can order production on a variety of recipes, but in the case of the extractor, there will only be a couple of recipes available for it, depending on the planet you selected to start your base at. Your profession requires raw ore to process into refined metal, so we will select one of the ore recipes for your extractor to extract from. Next, you are going to see your order size slider. This increases the order size you wish to produce, but keep in mind it does not provide any other efficiency bonus apart from increasing the order size. So it is recommended to keep it at its lowest setting. Once you are satisfied with your order, click the queue order button. Your Extractor is now extracting raw ore from the planet!

Next, in your inventory you see that you also have 40 units of raw iron ore, 6 carbon, and 6 oxygen. Let's fire up the Smelter. As you can see, to produce refined iron, you will require 6 iron ore, 1 carbon and 1 oxygen. Let’s select the refined Iron recipe and hit queue order. Keep in mind that you can order multiple orders by clicking the Queue Order button again. It’s important to keep on top of your orders to ensure your factories are constantly producing.

Now that your extractor, and smelter are running, it’s best to wait until you get a sizable amount of refined iron. When you feel like you have enough, you will take it to the market to sell. Once you have sold your first batch of goods, it is recommended that you purchase more Carbon and Oxygen, and you currently don’t have the means to produce these commodities yourself.


This has been the Comprehensive Metallurgist Profession set up guide, and has been indicated as complete by the APEX module, so this video broadcast will now be concluded. Please continue further to the next video broadcast about next steps with your base. Thank you for choosing the Advanced System for the Facilitation of Production and Exchange for the Exodus of Mankind.
