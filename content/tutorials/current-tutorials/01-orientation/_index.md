Hello. And thank you for choosing APEX. The Advanced System for the Facilitation of Production and Exchange for the Exodus of Mankind. Welcome to your orientation of the galaxy! I am the Company Creation Assistant that comes complimentary with every download of an APEX module. To ensure your startup is as smooth as possible, my first task will be to onboard you to the galactic map. This map shows APEX users the various systems and the FTL lanes that connect these systems together. This map will be used by you, to map out production chains, shipping routes, and eventually, galactic empires. One thing this map will show once you enter the interface, is that the map has four sectors of space owned by the four major factions of humankind. Each one of these factions has at least one space station that acts as local headquarters for the faction, but more importantly, these space stations house the commodity exchanges of the galaxy, typically called CX's by APEX users. These commodity exchanges are the centers of trade that happen around the galaxy. It is a place where APEX users can post their bid and ask prices for various commodities created.

My second task will now be to get you sorted with your profession, and spool up your very first production chain. However, APEX realizes time is money, and so if you are interested in learning about the in's and out's of the APEX module, and the galaxy, continue on with the Comprehensive APEX setup program. However, if you are interested in a brief introduction to the APEX interface and its features, we have created the Express setup program. And finally, if you are interested in getting going as fast as possible, APEX recommends continuing on to the Hyper Express setup program. Each one of these setup programs can be found in the video channel viewer, and have been labeled for ease of access.

This task has been indicated as complete by the APEX module, so this video broadcast will now be concluded. Thank you for choosing the Advanced System for the Facilitation of Production and Exchange for the Exodus of Mankind.
